Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python

Solving problems is the core of computer science. Programmers must first understand how a human solves a problem, then understand how to translate this "algorithm" into something a computer can do, and finally how to "write" the specific syntax (required by a computer) to get the job done.

# Here are the steps to improve your problem solving skills and to solve the programming problem in Python:

  * Read the problem at least three times
  * Work through the problem manually
  * Simplify and optimize your steps
  * Write pseudocode
  * Translate pseudocode into code and debug
  * Simplify and optimize your code
  * Debug
  * Write useful comments
  * Get feedback through code reviews
  * Practice, practice, practice
